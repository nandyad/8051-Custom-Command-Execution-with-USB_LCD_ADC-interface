The coding has been done in assembly laguage by maintaining Structured programming that beginner can also understand.

File description:
89C51_CmdExec_USB_LCD.asm -  source file
89C51_CmdExec_USB_LCD.hex -  file can be generated using Keil/or other distributions for target chip.


Terminal for sending commands to the microcontroller from COM port of a computer can be achived using : "https://sites.google.com/site/terminalbpp/" Terminal Emulation Program. Before that Baud rate and listening COM port shall be set up to the terminal emulator.

###Keil-C51 Evaluation Kit allows to create programs for all 8051 derivative and shall be maintianed T&C mentioned by Keil.
###simulation can be done using Proteus which comes with license and shall be maintianed with T&C.
